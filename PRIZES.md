# ETHGlobal Hackathon Prizes (Quick Context)

This repo is being built with multiple sponsor tracks in mind. This file is a short, durable summary so we keep constraints and judging criteria in view while building.

## Yellow Network — $15,000

- **What it is:** State-channel-style execution: deposit once, transact off-chain instantly/gaslessly, and settle on-chain when the session ends (Yellow SDK + Nitrolite).
- **What they want:** A clear **session lifecycle** (open → many off-chain actions → close → on-chain settlement) with a working demo + video.
- **Why it fits Agent Arena:** Each match tick is an off-chain state update; match close finalizes balances and pays winners once.

## Uniswap Foundation — $10,000

- **Uniswap v4 Agentic Finance — $5,000:** Agent-driven liquidity/trading/routing systems on v4 pools; prioritize reliability, transparency, composability. Hooks optional (encouraged when useful).
- **Uniswap v4 Privacy DeFi — $5,000:** Privacy-enhancing designs for trading/liquidity that preserve verifiability and protocol integrity; Hooks optional.

## Sui — $10,000

- **What it is:** High-performance L1 with strong composability, pitched as a foundation for next-gen DeFi and longer-term ecosystem support.
- **Prizes:** Best Overall ($3,000) + up to 7 Notable Projects ($1,000 each).

## Arc (Circle) — $10,000

- **What it is:** Circle’s EVM-compatible L1 positioned as a USDC liquidity hub, integrated with Circle tooling (Gateway, Wallets, Bridge Kit, etc.).
- **Tracks:** Chain-abstracted USDC apps ($5,000), payouts/treasury ($2,500), agentic commerce w/ RWAs ($2,500).
- **Typical requirements:** Working frontend + backend, architecture diagram, demo video + docs, and use of specified Circle tools per track.

## LI.FI — $6,000

- **What it is:** Cross-chain execution layer (swap/bridge/contract calls) via one SDK/API to build “deposit from anywhere” and multi-step DeFi flows.
- **Tracks:** Composer in DeFi ($2,500), AI × LI.FI smart app ($2,000), LI.FI-powered integration ($1,500).
- **Typical requirements:** Use LI.FI SDK/API for a real cross-chain action; support ≥2 EVM chains; ship a working UI or clear script/CLI demo (track-dependent) + video.
